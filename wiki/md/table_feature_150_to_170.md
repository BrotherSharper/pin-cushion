# Details about the new features on the fork from p4535992

This table is a summary of the fixes and features that have been added from the latest official release of Death Save 1.5.0 to the 1.7.0 version I managed.

The fork was born from a request made to me by an acquaintance to fix some bugs on version 9, but afterwards the word spread and I started to put new features that were requested of me with consequent new use cases and bug fixes.

Apart from the new features, the real big difference is the use of the [jquery-powertip](https://github.com/stevenbenner/jquery-powertip) javascript project, to manage the preview. It also works quite well on mobile and automatically calculates the size of the preview based on the size of the window, so it has many strengths, but it does not use the standard foundryvtt library for rendering templates, but after many tests I decided that the solution based on the jQuery library it was much more dynamic at least for foundryvtt version 9.

**NOTE:** If you are interested in the chronological order you can check the releases in the github project.
